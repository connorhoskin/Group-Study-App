# Virtual Machines
## Backend Server (VM Name: "backend"):
- Hostname: backend-server
- IP Address: 192.168.56.22
- Purpose: This VM is set up as a backend server. It has its own private network and a synced folder configuration. The folder is synced from the host to the /vagrant directory on the VM with specific permissions.
- Provisioning: The VM is provisioned using a shell script named setup-backend.sh located in the vm_scripts directory. This script contains instructions on setting up the mysql data base and connecting it to run in a flask environment on the frontend.
Frontend Server (VM Name: "frontend"):

## Frontend Server (VMName: "frontend"):
- Hostname: frontend-server
- IP Address: 192.168.56.21
- Port Forwarding: The VM has port forwarding configured from guest port 5001 to host port 5001.
- Purpose: This VM is set up as a frontend server. It has both a private network and port forwarding configuration. Like the backend server, it also has a synced folder configuration.
- Provisioning: The VM is provisioned using a shell script named setup-frontend.sh located in the vm_scripts directory. This script contains setup instructions specific to the frontend server.

## Media Server (VM Name: "media"):
- Media Server (VMName: "media"):
- Hostname: media-server
- IP Address: 192.168.56.23
- Purpose: This VM seems to be dedicated to media-related tasks. It has its own private network and a synced folder configuration similar to the other VMs.
- Provisioning: The VM is provisioned using a shell script named setup-media.sh located in the vm_scripts directory. This script likely contains setup instructions specific to the media server.

## Repository Structure

- Vagrantfile: This file is used to set up a virtual environment using Vagrant. It defines all threevirtual machine's configurations.

- Backend Server (VM Name: "backend"):
    - setup-backend.sh: The provisioning script used to set up the backend virtual machine. Creates an SQL data base and links to front       end
    - setup-database.sql: This file contains the data base schema for the backend, it creates 3 different tables to handle users and          study groups
 - Frontend Server (VMName: "frontend"):
    - templates: These are the html templates that the routes in main_app.py point to, these pages are displayed to the user                - dashboard.html: The dashboard view for users.
    - host_meeting.html: A view to host a meeting.
    - index.html: The main landing page or homepage.

    - upload.html: A page to upload files.
    - view_files.html: A view to see uploaded files.
    - view_studygroups.html: A view to see study groups.
    - setup-frontend.sh: The provisioning script used to set up the frontend virtual machine. Uses flask to deploy a web server on            port 5001
    - main_app.py: The main application file written in Python. Contains the primary logic and routes for the web                             application.
  - Media Server (VM Name: "media"):
      - setup-media.sh: The provisioning script used to set up the media server. This script intialises a Apache server to host an end          point for file uploads and virtual communication through the use of jitsi
      - upload.html: is an html page that is rendering on the web apache server
      - upload.php: is the php script that recieves and displays files
   


## Getting Started

- Clone the repository locally on your computer
- Make sure vagrant is installed
- Cd into the cloned repositry and run vagrant up
- Wait unitl all Virutal Machines boot and then head to http://127.0.0.1:5001


## Conclusion
This repository contains a web application with functionalities related to meetings, user sessions, and file uploads. New developers should focus on main_app.py for the main application logic and the templates directory for the user interface. Ensure to set up the environment and database as mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.
